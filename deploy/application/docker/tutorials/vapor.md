## Overview

For now, Clever Cloud does not allow you to deploy a Swift application. If you're planning on deploying a [server-side Swift](https://swift.org/server/) application, you will need to use a Docker container. This page will explain how to set up your application to run it on our service.

For a Vapor app deployed using Docker, you can use a `nano` scaler, it's enough in most cases. For more information about scalability, see [Application scaling]({{< ref "/administrate/scalability.md" >}}).

{{< alert "info" "Default Vapor Dockerfile" >}}
When you create a Vapor app using `vapor new`, Vapor's template already contains a Dockerfile. If you don't have it, or you want to check if it's up-to-date, you can find it at [github.com/vapor/template/Dockerfile](https://github.com/vapor/template/blob/d94759af430949cbcf4e4e70efc58ff1cfd9dc8d/Dockerfile).

## Fixing problems

### Fix 'unable to find bundle'

If your Swift package includes bundle resources, they won't be found at runtime because the Dockerfile doesn't copy it. You might have errors like `Fatal error: could not load resource bundle` or other similar messages.

To fix this, add the (long) line below:

```diff
# Switch to the staging area
WORKDIR /staging

# Copy main executable to staging area
RUN cp "$(swift build --package-path /build -c release --show-bin-path)/Run" ./

# [â€¦]

+ # Copy bundles to staging area
+ RUN cp "$(swift build --package-path /build -c release --show-bin-path)/*.bundle" ./ 2>/dev/null || :
+
# ================================
# Run image
# ================================
```

### Check your Dockerfile

To check if your Dockerfile is up-to-date, head up to [github.com/vapor/template/Dockerfile](https://github.com/vapor/template/blob/d94759af430949cbcf4e4e70efc58ff1cfd9dc8d/Dockerfile). Look for recent commits, which could be patching an issue you're facing.

### Check Vapor's documenation

In addition, don't hesitate to check [Vapor's documentation on how to deploy using Docker](https://docs.vapor.codes/4.0/deploy/docker/) if you have any Vapor-specific question, as their documentation will stay up-to-date.
